###How to trigger indexation

TODO: describe indexation event and all parameters,
describe why indexers should not be called directly

TODO: describe CLI command and its parameters used for indexation


###Search indexer

TODO: describe methods in Indexer interface, what they
are doing, what parameters are expected (including context)


###Search indexer events

TODO: what events are triggered during the indexation,
what are the responsibilities of these events


###Asynchronous search indexer

what are the differences between regular and async indexer


###Example
