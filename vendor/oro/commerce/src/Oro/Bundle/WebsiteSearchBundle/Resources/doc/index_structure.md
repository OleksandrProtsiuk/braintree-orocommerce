Search index structure
======================


###Indexed data

TODO: how entity data is stored, what data might be in index (data types),
special fields (all_text)


###Plain data structure

TODO: why plain structure, how to convert multi-level array to plain data and
how to work with it 


###Website scope

TODO: why different websites might have different data, website ID suffix in alias,
transparent work with website


###Localized data

TODO: why it is needed to store all localizations in index, advantages and 
disadvantages of this approach, transparent work with localization,
special localized fields (all_text_LOCALIZATION_ID)


###Examples

TODO: first example - simple data without localized fields with all_text

TODO: second example - complex data with multi-level converted data, localized fields
and all_text_LOCALIZATION_ID
